# Make Dates and Times Fun! with moment.js

These are the slides I used to give my talk at
[charmCityJS](http://www.meetup.com/charmcityjs/events/221665113/). The slides
are little hard to follow without the actual talk, but the gifs are good!

**tl;dr** If you're doing a good amount of date/time handling with vanilla
JavaScript, stop! Use [moment.js](momentjs.com).
